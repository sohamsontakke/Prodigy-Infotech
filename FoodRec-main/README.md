# Food Recognition
This is a machine learning model that is used to detect and recognize food items from the UEC-256FOOD dataset.

## Own Model
In the own model jupyter notebook, you will find my own implementation of a machine learning model, that acheived an accuracy of 56%.

## InceptionV3 Model
In the InceptionV3 model jupyter notebook, you will find a tweaked implementation of the InceptionV3 pre-trained model, that acheived an accuracy of 75%.

## Streamlit WebApp
The web application created with streamlit, visualizes the model. It gives the user the ability to upload an image of food, and the model should be able to provide feedback on what food items are present in the image.
